# README

This is my attempt at running two X-Nucleo-IHM01A1 shields (stepper motor controllers) on a
STM32 Nucleo-F411RE evaluation board. Current goal is to replicate the functionality of an
[mbed](https://mbed.com) example code
[`HelloWorld_IHM01A1_2Motors`](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/ST/code/HelloWorld_IHM01A1_2Moto
rs). No disrespect intended, but I favor C over C++ without all of the information hiding that
mbed code contains. For learning purposes I want to know exactly what my code does.

Feel free to use my code as you see fit. This is a work in progress.


## Board connections

* Nucleo F411RE
* Two X-NUCLEO IHM01A1 shields, properly configured with the solder bridges
* Two stepper motors
* Compatible power supply or supplies
